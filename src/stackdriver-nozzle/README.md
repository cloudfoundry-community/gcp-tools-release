## stackdriver-nozzle

A service that connects to the [Cloud Foundry firehose][cf-firehose] and sends
logs and metrics to [Google Stackdriver][goog-sd].

[cf-firehose]: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html
[goog-sd]: https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/

### Installation

```sh
go get github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stackdriver-tools/src/stackdriver-nozzle
```

### Configuration

`stackdriver-nozzle` is configured through the following environment variables:

#### Firehose

- `FIREHOSE_ENDPOINT` - the CF API endpoint; e.g., `https://api.bosh-lite.com'
- `FIREHOSE_EVENTS_TO_STACKDRIVER_LOGGING` - comma-separated list of events to pass to Stackdriver Logging;
  valid events are `LogMessage`,  `Error`, `HttpStartStop`, `ValueMetric` (BETA), `CounterEvent` (BETA),
  `ContainerMetric` (BETA)
- `FIREHOSE_EVENTS_TO_STACKDRIVER_MONITORING` - comma-separated list of events to pass to Stackdriver Monitoring;
  valid events are  `ValueMetric`, `CounterEvent`, and `ContainerMetric`
- `FIREHOSE_USERNAME` - CF username; defaults to `admin`
  - requires `doppler.firehose` and `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` permissions
- `FIREHOSE_PASSWORD` - CF password; defaults to `password`
- `FIREHOSE_SKIP_SSL` - whether to ignore SSL (please don't); defaults to
  `false`

#### Stackdriver

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` - the GCP project ID; will be automatically configured from
  the environment using [metadata][metadata] if left empty

[metadata]: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata

#### Nozzle

- `FOUNDATION_NAME` - sets the value of the "foundation" label added to every
  metric / log exported to Stackdriver; defaults to "cf". This is useful for
  differentiating between multiple cloud foundry / BOSH instances in the same
  GCP / Stackdriver project.
- `HEARTBEAT_RATE` - how often `stackdriver-nozzle` reports stats to stdout;
  defaults to 30 seconds
- `LOGGING_BATCH_COUNT` - how many logs to batch into a single report to
  Stackdriver; defaults to 10
- `LOGGING_BATCH_DURATION` - maximum time to batch logs to Stackdriver; defaults to 1
  second
- `METRICS_BUFFER_DURATION` - flush interval (in seconds) of the internal metric
  buffer; defaults to 30
- `METRICS_BATCH_SIZE` - batch size for metric time series being sent to
  Stackdriver; defaults to 200
- `METRIC_PATH_PREFIX` - sets a prefix for all custom metrics exported to
  Stackdriver, e.g. custom.googleapis.com/PREFIX/gorouter.total_requests;
  defaults to "firehose". May contain slashes. Useful to "namespace"
  cloud foundry metrics from others in the same Stackdriver project.
- `RESOLVE_APP_METADATA` - whether to hydrate app UUIDs into org name, org
  UUID, space name, space UUID, and app name; defaults to `true`
- `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - what subscription ID to use for connecting to the
  firehose; defaults to `stackdriver-nozzle`

#### Event Filters

Event filters allow users to selectively enable or disable the processing of
firehose events by the Stackdriver Nozzle. The default behaviour is to process
all events. Events that match a blacklist filter will not be processed unless
they also match a whitelist filter.

A filter rule has three elements:

*   A *regexp*, which must be a valid regular expression.
*   A *type*, which may be either "name" or "job".
    *   *name* matches against a concatenation of event _origin_ and metric
        _name_ with "." (e.g. `gorouter.total_requests`), and is only applicable
        for CounterEvent and ValueMetric event types.
        *   *job* matches against the event _job_.
*   A *sink*, which may be either "monitoring", "logging", or "all". The
    latter applies the rule to all firehose events, while the other two
    restrict the filter rule to events destined for Stackdriver Monitoring
    or Logging respectively.

These filter rules are expressed as a JSON object with two keys "blacklist" and
"whitelist". They are loaded from the file named in `EVENT_FILTER_FILE`. It is
valid to omit either or both keys. Please take special care when escaping
regexp metacharacters with backslashes, because JSON!

An example filter file:

```json
{
    "blacklist": [
        {"sink": "all", "type": "job", "regexp": "^router$"}
    ],
    "whitelist": [
        {"sink": "monitoring", "type": "name", "regexp": "^gorouter\\..*requests"},
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Usage

```sh
go run main.go
```

### Development

Run `make newb` to install required development dependencies.

A [.envrc.template][envrc-template] template is provided for a quick setup. We
suggest copying it to `.envrc` and using [direnv][direnv] to automatically set
the environment variables when you're in the `stackdriver-nozzle` directory.

[envrc-template]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stackdriver-tools/blob/master/src/stackdriver-nozzle/.envrc.template
[direnv]: http://direnv.net/

When running on GCP, `stackdriver-nozzle` will [automatically configure][dts]
the required credentials and project ID, but they will need to be provided
manually through environment variables (see above) when running locally. You
can get the credentials JSON file by following [Google's instructions
here][goog-creds] from the [credentials console][cred-console].

[dts]: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/oauth2/google#DefaultTokenSource
[goog-creds]: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials
[cred-console]: https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apis/credentials

[Ginkgo][ginkgo] is used for testing.

```sh
ginkgo -r

### Dependencies

This project uses [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) for
dependency management.

```
govendor fetch +missing
