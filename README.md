# Google Cloud Platform Tools BOSH Release

This is a [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) release for [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) Tools:

* A job acting as a Syslog endpoint to send platform logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/)
* A job that forwards [Cloud Foundry Firehose](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose) event data (including application logs) to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/)
* A job (to be collocated with other jobs) to send host metrics to [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/)

## Disclaimer

** This BOSH release can only be deployed to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)**

This is NOT presently a production ready BOSH release. This is just a Proof of Concept. It is suitable for experimentation and may not become supported in the future.

## Access Control

The follow roles are required for the service account on each deployed instance:

 - `roles/logging.logWriter` to stream logs to Stackdriver Logging
 - `roles/logging.configWriter` to setup CloudFoundry specific metrics on Stackdriver Monitoring

See the [access control documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/access-control) for more information.

## Enabled Services

To use Stackdriver Monitoring ensure the [Stackdriver Monitoring API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/monitoring.googleapis.com/overview) is enabled.

## Usage

### Upload the BOSH release

To use this BOSH release, first upload it to your BOSH:

```
bosh target BOSH_HOST
bosh upload https://storage.googleapis.com/bosh-releases/gcp-tools-1.tgz
```

### Deploying Stackdriver Logging

Create a deployment file (use the [gcp-tools.yml](https://github.com.evandbrown/gcp-tools-release/blob/master/manifests/gcp-tools.yml) example manifest file as a starting point).

Using the previous created deployment manifest, now deploy it:

```
bosh deployment path/to/deployment.yml
bosh -n deploy
```

Once deployed:
* the `google_fluentd` will act as a Syslog endpoint and will forward logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/)

If you want to send all your Cloud Foundry component's logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/), configure your Cloud Foundry manifest adding (or updating):

```
properties:
  ...
  syslog_daemon_config:
    address: <google-fluentd job instance IP address>
    port: 514
    transport: udp
```

### Deploying Stackdriver Monitoring

Add the `gcp-tools` release to the `release` section of your existing deployment manifest:

```
release:
   ...
  - name: gcp-tools
    version: "1"
```

Collocate the `stackdriver_agent` job template in all job instances:

```
jobs:
  - name: nats
    templates:
      - name: nats
        release: cf
      - name: metron_agent
        release: cf
      - name: stackdriver_agent
        release: gcp-tools
```

Once deployed, the `stackdriver_agent` on every instance will send host metrics to [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/).
