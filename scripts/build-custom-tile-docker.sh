# This script builds a BOSH release of stackdriver-tools and uses the tile
# generator to package it into a tile. It expects VERSION to be set to a valid
# semantic version, GOPATH to be set, and PATH to include ${GOPATH}/bin, which
# must contain the `bosh2`, `golint` and `ginkgo` binaries.
#
# It is meant to be run by the custom-tile.sh script within a container, but
# if all the dependencies are satisfied locally it will probably work fine.
